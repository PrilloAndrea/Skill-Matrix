Day 2:


 1. After task day 1 to start up the p'roject, 
 in the day 2(two) we located a lot of issues with types of variables .This was a big problem for us because the types of the variables didn't correspond with the       large amount of data that the app is going to collect.
 Our main focus was dealing with types of variables and after finishing, our main thoughts was to prepare the dummy data in seed table. 


 2.The seed's table is created in base of the tables we was created before for users, board, survey, questins and asnswers. Inserting data had an issue that the type of the variables didn't had the default value. Every table has her own primary and foreign key to have relations betwwen them and the data was succesfully applied on HASURA.
